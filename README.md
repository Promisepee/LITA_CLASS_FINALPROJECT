### Project Title: Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store
## Project Overview
In this project, I will be analyzing the sales performance of a Retail store.
By analysing this, I will need to explore sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends. The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights these findings.
